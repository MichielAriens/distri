There are three programs you may need to run. 
They can be run on different nodes after correct setup. 
Client connections can be configured in BasicClient.
Server setup can be configured in StartServer

Start the central server: 
	-start rmiregistry
	-run rental.StartServer
	NOTE: This server has no companies registered yet.
	
Start a company node
	-Use the class client.CompanyNode (CompanyNode(String name, String companyConfigFilePath))
	-main in CompanyNode starts dockx and hertz
	
Start or write a client:
	-Client implements AbstractScriptedTripTest
	-BasicClient is an abstract class you can extend to create clients. It provides a connection to the server.
	-RenterTestClient provides a simple test implementation of BasicClient
